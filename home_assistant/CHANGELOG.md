## What's Changed in v3.10.7

- Reverted defaulting of RECORD_PATH option specifying `{cam_name}` instead of `%path` (need to fix that another way)
- Changed the MediaMTX config builder to emit correct config for recording.
  
## What's Changed in v3.10.6

- ~Changed the documentation and defaults for the RECORD_PATH option to specify `{cam_name}` instead of `%path` to
  eliminate recording errors~ Reverted in v3.10.7
- Add exception handling to ffmpeg pruning logic to prevent snapshot prunes from killing each other
- Now gathers the list of parents that might be pruned and does that after purging the files
- Fixed python lint message in get_livestream_cmd

## What's Changed in v3.10.5

- Fix regression for snapshot pruning

## What's Changed in v3.10.4

- Catch exceptions when pruning snapshots so we don't stop grabbing them if something breaks a prune.
- Allow the ffmpeg error messages to reach the normal runtime
- Bump to [MediaMTX 1.12.2](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/tag/v1.12.2) to [fix regression on RaspberryPIs](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/compare/v1.12.1...v1.12.2)

## What's Changed in v3.10.3

- Bump MediaMTX to 1.12.1

## What's Changed in v3.10.2

- Added code to protect against the aggressive syntax check in MediaMTX 1.12.0 which 
  complains about the `recordPath` missing required elements even when recording is
  not enabled (it really shouldn't validate that setting unless one or more paths
  request recording...and didn't through 1.11.3).
  For reference, the pattern is computed from our `RECORD_PATH` and `RECORD_FILE_NAME`
  settings and the combination of them must contain the `strftime` format specifiers
  of *either* a `"%s"` or **all** of of "%Y", "%m", "%d", "%H", "%M", "%S" (case-sensitive).
  If the value is not compliant, to keep MediaMTX from erroring out, we append `"_%s"` whatever 
  was specified and emit a warning.
- Changed the default `RECORD_PATH` to ~`"record/%path/%Y/%m/%d/"`~ *v3.10.7* `"%path/{cam_name}/%Y/%m/%d"`
- Changed the default `RECORD_FILE_NAME` to `"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`

## What's Changed in v3.10.1

- Add `TOTP_KEY` and `MQTT_DTOPIC` to *config.yml* schema to avoid logged warning noise
- Add `MQTT_DTOPIC` to *config.yml* options to ensure a usable default
- Add `video: true` to all the *config.yml* variants to ensure hardware encoding can
  use video card
- Upgrade to `python:3.13-slim-bookworm` for docker base image
- Cleaned up Dockerfile scripts for testing and multiarch
- Safer docker build by testing the tarballs downloaded for MediaMTX or FFMpeg

## What's Changed in v3.10.0

- Attempt upgrade of MediaMTX to 1.12.0 (again)
- Fixed schema of RECORD_LENGTH config option (it needs an `s` or `h` suffix, so must be string)
- Added RECORD_KEEP to the config.yml so it can be actually be configured in the add-on

## What's Changed in v3.0.7

- Better logging of exceptions and pass the MediaMTX messages through to main logs
- Correct building of permissions for MediaMTX
- Documented all the possible points in the docker-compose files.

## What's Changed in v3.0.6

- Revert MediaMTX to 1.11.3 because 1.12 doesn't work here.

## What's Changed in v3.0.5 ~DELETED~

- Fix MediaMTX to pass a user name [since 1.12.0 now requires one](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/compare/v1.11.3...v1.12.0#diff-b5c575fc54691bae05c5cc598fac91c97876b3d15687c359f970a8b832ab3ab6R23-R41)
